Social Activist is a fictional online periodical I created to demonstrate my ability to create a UI that follows responsive/mobile-first principles based on a provided layout.

The layout and overall design follows [Socialist Alternative, issue #54](https://www.socialistalternative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SA54-June-2019-webFINAL.pdf)
