Social Activism is a mock periodical adapted for online consumption from a traditional newspaper source: [Socialist Alternative, issue #54](https://www.socialistalternative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SA54-June-2019-webFINAL.pdf)


I completed this project to achieve two main goals: 
+ Demonstrate ability in crafting a semantic, responsive/mobile-first UI from a static reference.
+ Gain experience in using the key features of a CSS pre-processor (Sass), including nesting, modularization, mixins, and variables.
