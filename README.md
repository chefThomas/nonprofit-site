Social Activism is a mock periodical that I undertook to achieve two main goals: 
    1) Demonstrate ability in crafting a responsive/mobile-first UI based on an existing product, using semantic HTML. 
    2) Utilize the key features of a CSS pre-processor (Sass), including nesting, modularization, mixins, and variables. 
    
The layout and design is adapted for online consumption from a traditional newspaper source: [Socialist Alternative, issue #54](https://www.socialistalternative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SA54-June-2019-webFINAL.pdf)
